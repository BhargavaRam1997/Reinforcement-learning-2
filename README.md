# Reinforcement-Learning
Modular implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms

## I will be gradually refactoring and moving the implementation to different repositories!! Eventually it will no longer be maintained.
- **Algorithms from the Q learning family will be moved to https://github.com/cyoon1729/deep-Q-networks.**
- **Algorithms from the PG family will be moved to another repository as well, which has not been created yet.**


# Is done:

- DQN
- Double DQN
- Dueling DQN
- A2C
- DDPG

# Requirements:
- Python 3
- PyTorch 0.4.1
- OpenAI Gym
