# Reinforcement-Learning
Modular implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms

## I will be gradually refactoring and moving the implementation to different repositories!! Eventually it will no longer be maintained.
- **Algorithms from the Q learning family will be moved to https://github.com/cyoon1729/deep-Q-networks.**
- **Algorithms from the PG family will be moved https://github.com/cyoon1729/Policy-Gradient-Methods.**
- Implementations in the two repositories above are of better quality. Please go to those instead.


# Is done:
- REINFORCE
- DQN
- Double DQN
- Dueling DQN
- A2C
- DDPG
check the two new repositories for more implementations

# Requirements:
- Python 3
- PyTorch 0.4.1
- OpenAI Gym
